# VNC Server Almost Automatic Installation

(Still fully functional as of February 9th, 2019)

Installs VNC Server (Almost) Completely, all you need to do is enter a VNC password.

Currently for Ubuntu 14.04, and any newer versions (as of 18.04).

XFCE4 will run on lightweight VPS boxes smoothly. 

I have ran it on as little as 128MB ram and single shared CPU.
